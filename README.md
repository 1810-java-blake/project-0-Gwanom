# project-0-Gwanom
This project is a webpage that allows users to collectively add to an
online playlist through the Spotify API
While on the page, the SPotify SDK will also allow users to listen to 
the playlist

Planned/Future features:
    Home page:
        - A brief explanation of the project with spotify 
        brand-compliant design
        - A player at the bottom of the page to listen to the playlist
        - This player would hopefully maintain across all 3 pages 
    Playlist Page:
        - Users may add a song to the list, with the idea being
        that the project is curating a list of everyone's favorite songs.
        - If the site were to go live, there exists the potential for the list to become massive; it may be hundereds of hours long.
